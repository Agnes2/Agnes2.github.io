      <description>Addressed pretty significant page load performance issue founde in larger deployments. Eliminates uses of intensive backend query, replacing it with an asynchronous API call against a lucene index. This change reduces page load from from 2+ minutes to nearly instant, with an incredibly responsive UI.</description>

      <title>Sex differences in early-onset Alzheimer’s disease</title>

      <description>ABSTRACT
INTRODUCTION: Sex is believed to drive heterogeneity in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), although evidence in early-onset AD (&amp;lt;65 years, EOAD) is scarce.
METHODS: We included 62 EOAD patients and 44 healthy controls (HC) with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD’s core biomarkers and neurofilament light chain levels, neuropsychological assessment, and 3T-MRI. We measured cortical thickness (CTh) and hippocampal subfield volumes (HpS) using Freesurfer. Adjusted linear models were used to analyze sex-differences and the relationship between atrophy and cognition.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the performance of Bayesian and frequentist approaches for longitudinal modeling: application to Alzheimer’s disease</title>
      <link>https://Agnes2.github.io/publications/2022-bayvsfreq/</link>

      <description>ABSTRACT
Linear mixed effects (LME) modelling under both frequentist and Bayesian frameworks can be used to study longitudinal trajectories. We studied the performance of both frameworks on different dataset configurations using hippocampal volumes from longitudinal MRI data across groups—healthy controls (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients, including subjects that converted from MCI to AD. We started from a big database of 1250 subjects from the Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI), and we created different reduced datasets simulating real-life situations using a random-removal permutation-based approach.</description>

      <title>Added Docker Build Status Badge to shields.io</title>
      <link>https://Agnes2.github.io/projects/contributions/shields-docker/</link>

      <description>Shields.io is a massive library of badges that can be inserted into project README&amp;rsquo;s or websites displaying various statuses (code coverage, health, version, etc). Support for docker was missing the current build health, and was a pretty trivial addition.</description>

      <description>BOSH (Bosh Outer SHell) &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; is an open source tool for release engineering, deployment, lifecycle management, and monitoring of distributed systems.&amp;rdquo; And it&amp;rsquo;s amazingly powerful. This examples uses BOSH to provision an Alassian vendor app running on JDK along with the support Postgres database and agents to support it. The releases manages the health of services and will automatically provision, start/stop processes across the various services.</description>

      <title>Forcing Visits to use SSL</title>

      <description>Intro Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether it&amp;rsquo;s a CakePHP app for a client, your own personal CMS, or any other web based application. If your passing around passwords or other sensitive info you should really implement SSL. SSL provides 2 main perks to your visitors.
First it encrypts all communication that flies across the web. This prevents curious or devious billies from getting your secrets. Secondly it ensures to the user that your server is in fact who it claims, and not a nasty &amp;lsquo;man in the middle&amp;quot; attack.</description>
