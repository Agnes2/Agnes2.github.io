**ABSTRACT**

Background: MRI atrophy predicts cognitive status in AD. However, this relationship has not been investigated in early-onset AD (EOAD, < 65 years) patients with a biomarker-based diagnosis.

Methods: Forty eight EOAD (MMSE ≥ 15; A + T + N +) and forty two age-matched healthy controls (HC; A − T − N −) from a prospective cohort underwent full neuropsychological assessment, 3T-MRI scan and lumbar puncture at baseline. Participants repeated the cognitive assessment annually. We used linear mixed models to investigate whether baseline cortical thickness (CTh) or subcortical volume predicts two-year cognitive outcomes in the EOAD group.

Results: In EOAD, hemispheric CTh and ventricular volume at baseline were associated with global cognition, language and attentional/executive functioning 2 years later (p < 0.0028). Regional CTh was related to most cognitive outcomes (p < 0.0028), except verbal/visual memory subtests. Amygdalar volume was associated with letter fluency test (p < 0.0028). Hippocampal volume did not show significant associations.

Conclusion: Baseline hemispheric/regional CTh, ventricular and amygdalar volume, but not the hippocampus, predict two-year cognitive outcomes in EOAD.
