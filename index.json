Neuropsychology.\nABSTRACT\nObjective: Subtle decline in memory is thought to arise in the preclinical phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, detecting these initial cognitive difficulties cross-sectionally has been challenging, and the exact nature of the decline is still debated. Accelerated long-term forgetting (ALF) has been recently suggested as one of the earliest and most sensitive indicators of memory dysfunction in subjects at risk of developing AD. The objective of this study was to design and validate the 1-week memory battery (1WMB) for assessing episodic memory and ALF in cognitively unimpaired individuals. Method: The 1WMB is unique in that it assesses multimodal memory and measures recall at both short delay (20 min) and at long term (1 week). Forty-five cognitively unimpaired subjects were assessed with 1WMB and standardized neuropsychological tests. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), levels of anxiety and depression, and cognitive reserve were also measured. Results: The tests of 1WMB showed a high internal consistency, and concurrent validity was observed with standard tests of episodic memory and executive functions. The analysis revealed a greater loss of information at 1 week compared to short-term forgetting (20 min). Performance in the 1WMB was affected by age and educational level, but was not associated with levels of anxiety and depression. Unlike standard tests, performance in the 1WMB correlated with measures of SCD. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that the 1WMB has good psychometric properties, and future studies are needed to explore its potential usefulness to assess cognitively unimpaired subjects at increased risk of developing AD.\n","permalink":"https://Agnes2.github.io/publications/2023-neuropsico/","tags":["Neuropsychology","SCD"],"title":"Design and validation of the 1-week memory battery for assessing episodic memory and accelerated long-term forgetting in cognitively unimpaired subjects."},{"categories":null,"contents":"Agnès Pérez‐Millan, José Contador, Jordi Juncà‐Parella, Beatriz Bosch, Laia Borrell, Adrià Tort‐Merino, Neus Falgàs, Sergi Borrego‐Écija, Nuria Bargalló, Lorena Rami, Mircea Balasa, Albert Lladó, Raquel Sánchez‐Valle, Roser Sala‐Llonch. Human Brain Mapping.\nABSTRACT\nAlzheimer\u0026rsquo;s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are common causes of dementia with partly overlapping, symptoms and brain signatures. There is a need to establish an accurate diagnosis and to obtain markers for disease tracking. We combined unsupervised and supervised machine learning to discriminate between AD and FTD using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We included baseline 3T-T1 MRI data from 339 subjects: 99 healthy controls (CTR), 153 AD and 87 FTD patients; and 2-year follow-up data from 114 subjects. We obtained subcortical gray matter volumes and cortical thickness measures using FreeSurfer. We used dimensionality reduction to obtain a single feature that was later used in a support vector machine for classification. Discrimination patterns were obtained with the contribution of each region to the single feature. Our algorithm differentiated CTR versus AD and CTR versus FTD at the cross-sectional level with 83.3% and 82.1% of accuracy. These increased up to 90.0% and 88.0% with longitudinal data. When we studied the classification between AD versus FTD we obtained an accuracy of 63.3% at the cross-sectional level and 75.0% for longitudinal data. The AD versus FTD versus CTR classification has reached an accuracy of 60.7%, and 71.3% for cross-sectional and longitudinal data respectively. Disease discrimination brain maps are in concordance with previous results obtained with classical approaches. By using a single feature, we were capable to classify CTR, AD, and FTD with good accuracy, considering the inherent overlap between diseases. Importantly, the algorithm can be used with cross-sectional and longitudinal data.\n","permalink":"https://Agnes2.github.io/publications/2023-mllong/","tags":["AD","FTD","Longitudinal Study","MRI","Machine Learning"],"title":"Classifying Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal dementia using machine learning with cross‐sectional and longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging data"},{"categories":null,"contents":"AUTHORS: Sergi Borrego-Écija, Agnès Pérez-Millan, John C van Swieten, Lize Jiskoot, Fermin Moreno, Robert Laforce, Caroline Graff, Mario Masellis, Maria Carmela Tartaglia, James B Rowe, Barbara Borroni, Elizabeth Finger, Matthis Synofzik, Daniela Galimberti, Rik Vandenberghe, Alexandre de Mendonça, Chris R Butler, Alexander Gerhard, Simon Ducharme, Isabelle Le Ber, Isabel Santana, Florence Pasquier, Johannes Levin, Markus Otto, Sandro Sorbi, Pietro Tiraboschi, Harro Seelaar, Tobias Langheinrich, Jonathan D Rohrer, Roser Sala-Llonch, Raquel Sánchez-Valle \u0026amp; The Genetic FTD Initiative, GENFI.\nTITLE: Loss of brainstem white matter predicts onset and motor neuron symptoms in C9orf72 expansion carriers: a GENFI study.\nCONFERENCE: 33rd International Symposium on ALS/MND\nPLACE: Virtual\nDATES: December 6 - 9, 2022\n","permalink":"https://Agnes2.github.io/conferences/2022-alsmnd/","tags":["FTD","C9orf72","GENFI","MRI"],"title":"33rd International Symposium on ALS/MND"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Gonzalo Forno, Jose Contador, Agnès Pérez‐Millan, Nuria Guillen, Neus Falgàs, Jordi Sarto, Adrià Tort‐Merino, Magdalena Castellví, Beatriz Bosch, Guadalupe Fernández‐Villullas, Mircea Balasa, Anna Antonell, Roser Sala‐Llonch, Raquel Sanchez‐Valle, Michael Hornberger, Albert Lladó. European Journal of Neurology.\nABSTRACT\nBackground and purpose: How the APOE genotype can differentially affect cortical and subcortical memory structures in biomarker-confirmed early-onset (EOAD) and late-onset (LOAD) Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s disease (AD) was assessed.\nMethod: Eighty-seven cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker-confirmed AD patients were classified according to their APOE genotype and age at onset. 28 were EOAD APOE4 carriers (+EOAD), 21 EOAD APOE4 non-carriers (–EOAD), 23 LOAD APOE4 carriers (+LOAD) and 15 LOAD APOE4 non-carriers (–LOAD). Grey matter (GM) volume differences were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry in Papez circuit regions. Multiple regression analyses were performed to determine the relation between GM volume loss and cognition.\nResults: Significantly more mammillary body atrophy in +EOAD compared to –EOAD is reported. The medial temporal and posterior cingulate cortex showed less GM in +LOAD compared to –LOAD. Medial temporal GM volume loss was also found in +EOAD compared to –LOAD. With an exception for +EOAD, medial temporal GM was strongly associated with episodic memory in the three groups, whilst posterior cingulate cortex GM volume was more related with visuospatial abilities. Visuospatial abilities and episodic memory were also associated with the anterior thalamic nucleus in –LOAD.\nConclusions: Our results show that the APOE genotype has a significant effect on GM integrity as a function of age of disease onset. Specifically, whilst LOAD APOE4 genotype is mostly associated with increased medial temporal and parietal atrophy compared to –LOAD, for EOAD APOE4 might have a more specific effect on subcortical (mammillary body) structures. The findings suggest that APOE genotype needs to be taken into account when classifying patients by age at onset.\n","permalink":"https://Agnes2.github.io/publications/2022-apope/","tags":["AD","APOE4","EOAD","LOAD","MRI"],"title":"The APOE4 effect: structural brain differences in Alzheimer’s disease according to the age at symptom onset"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Agnès Pérez-Millan*, Sergi Borrego-Écija*, John C van Swieten, Lize Jiskoot, Fermin Moreno, Robert Laforce, Caroline Graff, Mario Masellis, Maria Carmela Tartaglia, James B Rowe, Barbara Borroni, Elizabeth Finger, Matthis Synofzik, Daniela Galimberti, Rik Vandenberghe, Alexandre de Mendonça, Chris R Butler, Alexander Gerhard, Simon Ducharme, Isabelle Le Ber, Isabel Santana, Florence Pasquier, Johannes Levin, Markus Otto, Sandro Sorbi, Pietro Tiraboschi, Harro Seelaar, Tobias Langheinrich, Jonathan D Rohrer, Roser Sala-Llonch, Raquel Sánchez-Valle \u0026amp; The Genetic FTD Initiative, GENFI (* equivalent contribution).

Corticospinal degeneration has been described in post-mortem neuropathological studies in these patients, especially in those with MND. We used MRI to analyze white matter (WM) volumes in presymptomatic and symptomatic C9orf72 expansion carriers and investigated whether its measure may be helpful in predicting the onset of symptoms.\nMethods: We studied 102 presymptomatic C9orf72 mutation carriers, 52 symptomatic carriers: 42 suffering from FTD and 11 from MND, and 75 non-carriers from the Genetic Frontotemporal dementia Initiative (GENFI). All subjects underwent T1-MRI acquisition. We used FreeSurfer to estimate the volume proportion of WM in the brainstem regions (midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata). We calculated group differences with ANOVA tests and performed linear and non-linear regressions to assess group-by-age interactions.\nResults: A reduced WM ratio was found in all brainstem subregions in symptomatic carriers compared to both noncarriers and pre-symptomatic carriers. Within symptomatic carriers, MND patients presented a lower ratio in pons and medulla oblongata compared with FTD patients. No differences were found between presymptomatic carriers and non-carriers. Clinical severity was negatively associated with the WM ratio. C9orf72 carriers presented greater age-related WM loss than non-carriers, with MND patients showing significantly more atrophy in pons and medulla oblongata.\nDiscussion: We find consistent brainstem WM loss in C9orf72 symptomatic carriers with differences related to the clinical phenotype supporting the use of brainstem measures as neuroimaging biomarkers for disease tracking.\n","permalink":"https://Agnes2.github.io/publications/2022-c9/","tags":["FTD","C9orf72","GENFI","MRI"],"title":"Loss of brainstem white matter predicts onset and motor neuron symptoms in C9orf72 expansion carriers: a GENFI study"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Agnès Pérez Millan, Laia Borrell, José Contador, Mircea Balasa, Albert Lladó, Raquel Sanchez-Valle, Roser Sala-Llonch.

We measured cortical thickness (CTh) and hippocampal subfield volumes (HpS) using Freesurfer. Adjusted linear models were used to analyze sex-differences and the relationship between atrophy and cognition.\nRESULTS:Compared to same-sex HC, female-EOAD showed greater cognitive impairment and broader atrophy burden than male-EOAD. In a direct female-EOAD and male-EOAD comparison, there were slight differences in temporal CTh, with no differences in cognition or HpS. CSF tau levels were higher in female-EOAD than in male-EOAD. Greater atrophy was associated with worse cognition in female-EOAD.\nCONCLUSIONS: At diagnosis, there are sex-differences in the pattern of cognitive impairment, atrophy burden and CSF tau in EOAD, suggesting there is an influence of sex on pathology spreading and susceptibility to the disease in EOAD.\n","permalink":"https://Agnes2.github.io/publications/2022-sex/","tags":["AD","EOAD","Sex Differences","MRI"],"title":"Sex differences in early-onset Alzheimer’s disease"},{"categories":null,"contents":"AUTHORS: Agnès Pérez-Millan, Laia Borrell,José Contador,Mircea Balasa, Albert Lladó, Raquel Sanchez-Valle, Roser Sala-Llonch.\nTITLE: Classification between Early Onset Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s disease and frontotemporal dementia using a single neuroimaging feature.\nCONFERENCE: Emerging Topics in Artificial Intelligence (ETAI) 2022\nPLACE: San Diego, Unitated States of America\nDATES: August 21 - 25, 2022\nABSTRACT:\nINTRODUCTION: Early Onset Alzheimer’s Disease (EOAD) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) are common forms of early-onset dementia.

Molecular Neurobiology.\nABSTRACT\nSporadic early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD) and autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease (ADAD) provide the opportunity to investigate the physiopathological mechanisms in the absence of aging, present in late-onset forms. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) causes early-onset dementia associated to tau or TDP43 protein deposits. A 15% of FTD cases are caused by mutations in C9orf72, GRN, or MAPT genes. Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) have been proposed as an alternative to brain tissue for studying earlier phases of neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this study is to investigate the expression profile in EOAD, ADAD, and sporadic and genetic FTD (sFTD and gFTD, respectively), using brain tissue and LCLs. Sixty subjects of the following groups were included: EOAD, ADAD, sFTD, gFTD, and controls. Gene expression was analyzed with Clariom D microarray (Affymetrix). Brain tissue pairwise comparisons revealed six common differentially expressed genes (DEG) for all the patients’ groups compared with controls: RGS20, WIF1, HSPB1, EMP3, S100A11 and GFAP. Common up-regulated biological pathways were identified both in brain and LCLs (including inflammation and glial cell differentiation), while down-regulated pathways were detected mainly in brain tissue (including synaptic signaling, metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction). CD163, ADAMTS9 and LIN7A gene expression disruption was validated by qPCR in brain tissue and NrCAM in LCLs in their respective group comparisons. In conclusion, our study highlights neuroinflammation, metabolism and synaptic signaling disturbances as common altered pathways in different AD and FTD forms. The use of LCLs might be appropriate for studying early immune system and inflammation, and some neural features in neurodegenerative dementias.\n","permalink":"https://Agnes2.github.io/publications/2022-gens/","tags":["AD","FTD","Differential Gene Expression"],"title":"Differential Gene Expression in Sporadic and Genetic Forms of Alzheimer’s Disease and Frontotemporal Dementia in Brain Tissue and Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines"},{"categories":null,"contents":"In this video I explain how mathematics could help in the diagnosis of diseases.\n","permalink":"https://Agnes2.github.io/news/2022-idibapsvideo/","tags":null,"title":"My outreach video is out!"},{"categories":null,"contents":"AUTHORS: Agnès Pérez-Millan, José Contador, Neus Falgàs, Núria Bargalló, Mircea Balasa, Albert Lladó, Raquel Sanchez-Valle, Roser Sala-Llonch.\nTITLE: Prognosis of Alzheimer’s Disease and Frontotemporal Dementia with a brain age model.\nCONFERENCE: OHBM 2022 ANNUAL MEETING\nPLACE: Glasgow, United Kingdom\nDATES: June 19 - 23, 2022\nABSTRACT:\nIntroduction: Alzheimer Disease (AD) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) are common forms of dementia, characterized by progressive brain atrophy at variable rates along the age continuum. Neuroimaging studies with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have showed that distinct brain atrophy patterns could potentially help in differentiating both diseases (Falgàs, 2020). Here, we introduce a framework for modelling and predicting the evolution of both dementias using region-wise Cortical Thickness (CTh) measures obtained from cross- sectional and longitudinal MRI scans.\nMethods: We included cross-sectional 3T-T1w MRI data of 322 subjects: 91 healthy controls (CTR, age: 62.2 ± 8.1 years), 82 Early Onset AD patients (EOAD, age: 58.0 ± 4.7 years), 63 Late Onset AD patients (LOAD, age: 72.3 ± 4.5 years) and 86 FTD patients (FTD, age: 63.3 ± 8.1 years). We also included longitudinal data (2 years approximately between visits) of 112 subjects with equal or equivalent acquisition protocols, all of them with a second visit (66 CTR [age: 64.5 ± 6.8 years], 16 EOAD [age: 60.5 ± 3.6 years], 4 LOAD [age: 68.5 ± 0.4 years] and 26 FTD [age: 63.8 ± 5.9 years]), and 43 with a third visit (34 CTR [age: 64.8 ± 5.3 years] and 9 FTD [age: 62.9 ± 4.3 years], patients with longer follow up were younger initially). We obtained regional CTh measures using FreeSurfer. Cross-sectional data was used to obtain models of trajectories separately for each group with Support Vector Regression (SVR). Then, these models were used to predict CTh values for each age-point and each group. We used a cross-validation of 10 to obtain the best parameters for the SVR. Overall, the accuracy of the predictions was assessed using leave one out cross validation approach quantified using root-mean-square error (RMSE). We used the longitudinal data (all the points from the successive visits) as unseen test data and to obtain individual predictions. Finally, we compared these values using the mean absolute error (MAE) for each region: each test subject was compared against its predicted value and against its corresponding baseline subject. For each region, we evaluated whether if the MAE between the baseline data and the longitudinal data was lower/greater than the MAE between the longitudinal point and the age-group predicted subject.\nResults: CTh trajectories according to age estimated with our SVR framework for each group are shown in animated Figure 1. The overall RMSE for these predictions was 0.01 for CTR and 0.02 for FTD, EOAD and LOAD. We described individual and disease signatures comparing the MAE values (Figure 2): if longitudinal data was more alike to its corresponding baseline data than to the age-group predicted data, this region was marked as individual signature; otherwise, if longitudinal data was more similar to the age-group prediction, the region was labeled as disease signature. According to that, at visit 2, for CTR and FTD, all regions were identified as individual signature (mean across subjects). However, for EOAD and LOAD we identified some regions at which the longitudinal points were closer to their age-group prediction than to the corresponding baseline subject. For the visit 3, CTR remained with a dominance of individual characteristics, however, FTD patients showed some disease specific regions.\nConclusions:We modeled separated age trajectories for CTR, EOAD, LOAD and FTD. Our framework allows predicting CTh values according to age and disease-group, offering whole-brain cortical models of disease progression. By using the longitudinal data in a prediction setting, we first found that, in the absence of disease, the individual characteristics might prevail over the age-defined trajectories. However, in disease (specially in AD forms), we identified a set of regions with strong disease effects, namely the disease signature. We highlight the use of age and group specific trajectories to obtain predictions that could ultimately be used in clinical settings.\n","permalink":"https://Agnes2.github.io/conferences/2022-ohbmapm/","tags":["AD","FTD","LOAD","Age Model","SVR","Longitudinal Study","MRI"],"title":"OHBM 2022 ANNUAL MEETING"},{"categories":null,"contents":"The first time on the radio, it was amazing!

We suggest using normative tem-plates according of cortical thickness (CTh) within different age ranges.\nMETHODS: We studied 497 MRIs of healthy controls (CTR), Early Onset AD (EOAD), Late Onset AD (LOAD) and FTD patients. Subjects were grouped according to age: [45-54 years] (21 CTR, 17 EOAD, 13 FTD), [55-64 years] (93 CTR, 77 EOAD, 63 FTD), [65-74 years] (73 CTR, 7 EOAD, 43 LOAD, 37 FTD) and [75-84 years] (15 CTR, 28 LOAD, 10 FTD). We obtained regional CTh and we generated group-normative maps using the mean and standard deviation (SD) of CTR. Then, Z scores were estimated as Zregion = (CThregion-CTh(CTRmean))/CTh(CTRSD) for each patient with its corre-sponding template. We compared these maps as well as global values at each age range.\nRESULTS: AD and FTD showed brain atrophy compared to CTR at all age groups. The effects of atrophy for both diseases with respect to CTR were stronger at younger ages (Figure 1). We describe differences between AD and FTD along the aging continuum with different patterns across ages (Fig-ure 2).\nCONCLUSION: We highlight the necessity of using age-matched templates to identify changes across the disease timeline for AD and FTD. At younger ages, EOAD and FTD had partly overlap-ping brain signatures. At older ages, LOAD and FTD clearly show a different pattern. These patterns can be used to support the differential diagnosis of these dementias.\n","permalink":"https://Agnes2.github.io/conferences/2022-adpd/","tags":["AD","FTD","EOAD","LOAD","Age Model","SVR","Longitudinal Study","MRI"],"title":"AD/PD 2022 International Conference on Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Diseases"},{"categories":null,"contents":"First poster in person for the AD/PD 2022 International Conference on Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Diseases.\n","permalink":"https://Agnes2.github.io/news/2022-adpd/","tags":null,"title":"Ready for AD/PD 2022"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I have visited Escola Meritxell (Mataró) with the project Camins Infinits.

However, this relationship has not been investigated in early-onset AD (EOAD, \u0026lt; 65 years) patients with a biomarker-based diagnosis.\nMethods: Forty eight EOAD (MMSE ≥ 15; A + T + N +) and forty two age-matched healthy controls (HC; A − T − N −) from a prospective cohort underwent full neuropsychological assessment, 3T-MRI scan and lumbar puncture at baseline. Participants repeated the cognitive assessment annually. We used linear mixed models to investigate whether baseline cortical thickness (CTh) or subcortical volume predicts two-year cognitive outcomes in the EOAD group.\nResults: In EOAD, hemispheric CTh and ventricular volume at baseline were associated with global cognition, language and attentional/executive functioning 2 years later (p \u0026lt; 0.0028). Regional CTh was related to most cognitive outcomes (p \u0026lt; 0.0028), except verbal/visual memory subtests. Amygdalar volume was associated with letter fluency test (p \u0026lt; 0.0028). Hippocampal volume did not show significant associations.\nConclusion: Baseline hemispheric/regional CTh, ventricular and amygdalar volume, but not the hippocampus, predict two-year cognitive outcomes in EOAD.\n","permalink":"https://Agnes2.github.io/publications/2021-baselineeoad/","tags":["AD","EOAD","Longitudinal Study","MRI"],"title":"Baseline MRI atrophy predicts 2-year cognitive outcomes in early-onset Alzheimer’s disease"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Agnès Pérez Millan, José Contador, Aida Niñerola-Baizán, Raúl Tudela, Xavier Setoain, Albert Lladó, Raquel Sanchez-Valle, Roser Sala-Llonch, for the Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.

During the course of these studies, scanner changes may contribute to the reliability of MRI-derived metrics. Here we aim to study the effects of changing from a 3T-Siemens Trio Trim (scanner 1) to a 3T-Siemens Prisma (scanner 2) on gray matter (GM) measures obtained from T1-weighted acquisitions.\nMETHODS: We studied 3 MRI-longitudinal datasets with 2 time points separated 2 years, all having available T1-weighted scans, with equal or equivalent acquisition protocols: A group of 14 healthy controls scanned with scanner 1 (CTR, median age [interquartile range, IQR] = 58.4 [54.7, 61.4] years); a group of 17 healthy controls, scanned at baseline with scanner 1 and after 2 years with scanner 2 (CTRc, median age [IQR] = 59.7 [49.0, 60.9]), and a group of 12 AD patients, scanned with scanner 1 (AD, median age [IQR] = 60.4 [58.0, 65.8]). All AD patients showed pathological levels of core CSF biomarkers (A+ T+) with neurodegeneration (N+), while all CTR subjects were within the normal biomarker range (NIA-AA 2018). We used cross-sectional and longitudinal processing streams of FreeSurfer to obtain summary measures, including subcortical GM volume, cortical thickness (CTh), cortical surface area and cortical GM volume, using available atlas of cortical parcellations and subcortical segmentations. We studied the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) to assess the reliability of the metrics for CTR and CTRc groups. We calculated the percent difference (PcD) to obtain the relative difference of GM measures between timepoints, for all groups. With the PcD measure, we aimed to study the magnitude of the changes due to the scanner in comparison with the effect of AD atrophy. We further focused on hippocampal atrophy, as it is considered a biomarker for AD.\nRESULTS: There were no differences in age and in time between acquisitions among the three datasets. When studying ICC in CTR and CTRc, we found that the longitudinal FreeSurfer stream provided higher mean ICC values. Of all the measures studied, ROI-CTh were the most affected by scanner change, with a mean across regions of 0.8 and 0.92 for the CTRc and CTR groups respectively (36 out of 68 regions were significantly different). We found differences between the CTR and CTRc groups in 16/68 regions surface area and 20/68 or the GM volume. However, mean ICC values were nearly 1 for both datasets for these metrics, indicating good reliability. As regards PcD, we consistently observed that longitudinal differences were stronger in AD than in CTR or CTRc groups (Figure 1). Mean PcD values for CTh (across parcellations) were: -0.20% for CTR, -1.53% for CTRc and -4.57% for AD. And mean PcD for subcortical GM volumes were (across atlas regions): -3.11% for CTR, -2.76% for CTRc and -10% for AD. Hippocampal atrophy was similar between CTR and CTRc with values nearly zero with no significant differences between them. In AD, hippocampal volume loss was stronger, showing significant differences with CTR and CTRc (Figure 2).\nCONCLUSIONS: We provide an analysis of longitudinal GM measures derived from T1-weighted MRI scans on 3 different datasets, accounting for scanner changes and AD progression. In general, we found small test-retest changes and high reproducibility rates in healthy controls when analyzed with the Freesurfer longitudinal stream, even when changing scanner. CTh was the most affected measure (although showing ICC nearly 1) by scanner changes, suggesting that further approaches could improve this measure. In AD, we found high rates of changes in comparison with both the CTR and CTRc groups, suggesting that the change of scanner is not a handicap in order to identify pathological brain processes in T1-weigthed data.\n","permalink":"https://Agnes2.github.io/conferences/2021-ohbm/","tags":["AD","MRI"],"title":"OHBM 2021 ANNUAL MEETING"},{"categories":null,"contents":"AUTHORS: Agnès Pérez-Millan, Laia Borrell, José Contador, Mircea Balasa, Albert Lladó, Raquel Sanchez-Valle, Roser Sala-Llonch.\nTITLE: Classification between Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal dementia using a single neuroimaging feature.\nCONFERENCE: 2021 Annual Meeting of the ISMRM Iberian Chapter\nPLACE: Virtual Event\nDATES: June 16 - 17, 2021\nABSTRACT:\nINTRODUCTION: Alzheimer Disease (AD) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) are common forms of early-onset dementia with different, but partly overlapping, symptoms and brain signatures. There is a need to establish accurate diagnosis and to obtain good markers for prognosis. We combined supervised and unsupervised machine learning (ML) to classify AD and FTD.\nMETHODS: We included 3T-T1 MRI of 44 healthy controls (CTR, age: 57.8 ± 5.4 years), 53 AD patients (AD, age: 59.4 ± 4.4 years) and 64 FTD patients (FTD, age: 64.4 ± 8.8 years). We obtained subcortical gray matter volumes and cortical thickness (CTh) using FreeSurfer. For ML we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) of all volumes and Cth values. Then, the first principal component (PC) was introduced into a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Overall performance was assessed using k-fold cross-validation.\nRESULTS: Our algorithm had an accuracy of 85.3 ± 13.6 % in the CTR vs AD classification, 84.2 ± 15.8 % for CTR vs FTD, 67.7 ± 18.5 % for AD vs FTD and 65.8 ± 14.0 % when discriminating the 3 groups. We used the first PC to create disease-specific patterns (Figure 1). Including age in the algorithm led to similar results.\nDISCUSSION \u0026amp; CONCLUSION: By using a single feature that combines information from CTh and subcortical volumes, our algorithm is capable to classify CTR, AD and FTD with fairly good accuracy. We suggest that this approach can be used to reduce the amount of data used in ML algorithms while providing interpretable atrophy patterns.\n","permalink":"https://Agnes2.github.io/conferences/2021-isrm/","tags":["AD","FTD","SVM","Machine Learning","MRI"],"title":"2021 Annual Meeting of the ISMRM Iberian Chapter"},{"categories":null,"contents":"José Contador, Agnès Pérez-Millán, Adrià Tort-Merino, Mircea Balasa, Neus Falgàs, Jaume Olives, Magdalena Castellví, Sergi Borrego-Écija, Beatriz Bosch, Guadalupe Fernández-Villullas, Oscar Ramos-Campoy, Anna Antonell, Nuria Bargalló, Raquel Sanchez-Valle, Roser Sala-Llonch, Albert Lladó, Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. NeuroImage: Clinical.\nABSTRACT\nThere is evidence of longitudinal atrophy in posterior brain areas in early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD; aged \u0026lt; 65 years), but no studies have been conducted in an EOAD cohort with fluid biomarkers characterization. We used 3T-MRI and Freesurfer 6.0 to investigate cortical and subcortical gray matter loss at two years in 12 EOAD patients (A + T + N + ) compared to 19 controls (A-T-N-) from the Hospital Clínic Barcelona cohort. We explored group differences in atrophy patterns and we correlated atrophy and baseline CSF-biomarkers levels in EOAD. We replicated the correlation analyses in 14 EOAD (A + T + N + ) and 55 late-onset AD (LOAD; aged ≥ 75 years; A + T + N + ) participants from the Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We found that EOAD longitudinal atrophy spread with a posterior-to-anterior gradient and beyond hippocampus/amygdala. In EOAD, higher initial CSF NfL levels correlated with higher ventricular volumes at baseline. On the other hand, higher initial CSF Aβ42 levels (within pathological range) predicted higher rates of cortical loss in EOAD. In EOAD and LOAD subjects, higher CSF t-tau values at baseline predicted higher rates of subcortical atrophy. CSF p-tau did not show any significant correlation. In conclusion, posterior cortices, hippocampus and amygdala capture EOAD atrophy from early stages. CSF Aβ42 might predict cortical thinning and t-tau/NfL subcortical atrophy.\n","permalink":"https://Agnes2.github.io/publications/2021-longitudinaleoad/","tags":["AD","EOAD","Longitudinal Study","MRI"],"title":"Longitudinal brain atrophy and CSF biomarkers in early-onset Alzheimer’s disease"},{"categories":null,"contents":"AUTHORS: José Contador, Roser Sala-Llonch, Agnès Pérez-Millan, Adrià Tort-Merino, Mircea Balasa, Neus Falgàs, Jaume Olives, Magdalena Castellví, Sergi Borrego-Écija, Beatriz Bosch, Guadalupe Fernández-Villullas, Oscar Ramos-Campoy, Anna Antonell, Raquel Sanchez-Valle i Albert Lladó.\nTITLE: Análisis transversal y longitudinal del patrón de atrofia en la enfermedad de Alzheimer de inicio precoz mediante RM-3T.\nCONFERENCE: LXXII Reunión Anual de la Sociedad Española de Neurología\nPLACE: Virtual Event\nDATES: November 23 - December 3, 2020\n","permalink":"https://Agnes2.github.io/conferences/2020-senjc/","tags":["AD","EOAD","MRI","Longitudinal Study"],"title":"LXXII Reunión Anual de la Sociedad Española de Neurología"},{"categories":null,"contents":"AUTHORS: José Contador, Roser Sala-Llonch, Agnès Pérez-Millan, Adrià Tort-Merino, Mircea Balasa, Neus Falgàs Martínez, Jaume Olives, Magdalena Castellví, Sergi Borrego-Écija, Beatriz Bosch, Guadalupe Fernández- Villullas, Oscar Ramos-Campoy,Anna Antonell, Raquel Sanchez-Valle and Albert Lladó.\nTITLE: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of the atrophy pattern in early-onset Alzheimer’s disease using 3T-MRI.\nCONFERENCE: AAIC NEURO-SCIENCE NEXT 2020\nPLACE: Virtual Event\nDATES: November 9-10, 2020\n","permalink":"https://Agnes2.github.io/conferences/2020-aaicjcnext/","tags":["AD","EOAD","MRI"],"title":"AAIC NEURO-SCIENCE NEXT 2020"},{"categories":null,"contents":"AUTHORS: José Contador, Roser Sala-Llonch, Agnès Pérez-Millan, Adrià Tort-Merino, Mircea Balasa, Neus Falgàs, Jaume Olives, Magdalena Castellví, Sergi Borrego-Écija, Beatriz Bosch, Guadalupe Fernández-Villullas, Oscar Ramos-Campoy, Anna Antonell, Raquel Sanchez-Valle y Albert Lladó.\nTITLE: Anàlisi transversal i longitudinal del patró d’atròfia en la malaltia d’Alzheimer d’inici precoç mitjançant RM-3T.\nCONFERENCE: XXIV Reunió Anual de la Societat Catalana de Neurologia\nPLACE: Virtual Event\nDATES: September 28 - October 2, 2020\n","permalink":"https://Agnes2.github.io/conferences/2020-sencjc/","tags":["AD","EOAD","MRI","Longitudinal Study"],"title":"XXIV Reunió Anual de la Societat Catalana de Neurologia"},{"categories":null,"contents":"AUTHORS: R Sala-Llonch, J.

Human Brain Mapping.\nABSTRACT\nPrior studies have described distinct patterns of brain gray matter and white matter alterations in Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), as well as differences in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers profiles. We aim to investigate the relationship between early-onset AD (EOAD) and FTLD structural alterations and CSF biomarker levels. We included 138 subjects (64 EOAD, 26 FTLD, and 48 controls), all of them with a 3T MRI brain scan and CSF biomarkers available (the 42 amino acid-long form of the amyloid-beta protein [Aβ42], total-tau protein [T-tau], neurofilament light chain [NfL], neurogranin [Ng], and 14-3-3 levels). We used FreeSurfer and FSL to obtain cortical thickness (CTh) and fraction anisotropy (FA) maps. We studied group differences in CTh and FA and described the “AD signature” and “FTLD signature.” We tested multiple regression models to find which CSF-biomarkers better explained each disease neuroimaging signature. CTh and FA maps corresponding to the AD and FTLD signatures were in accordance with previous literature. Multiple regression analyses showed that the biomarkers that better explained CTh values within the AD signature were Aβ and 14-3-3; whereas NfL and 14-3-3 levels explained CTh values within the FTLD signature. Similarly, NfL levels explained FA values in the FTLD signature. Ng levels were not predictive in any of the models. Biochemical markers contribute differently to structural (CTh and FA) changes typical of AD and FTLD.\n","permalink":"https://Agnes2.github.io/publications/2020-ohbm/","tags":["AD","EOAD","FTD","MRI"],"title":"Contribution of CSF biomarkers to early-onset Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal dementia neuroimaging signatures"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Shields.io is a massive library of badges that can be inserted into project README\u0026rsquo;s or websites displaying various statuses (code coverage, health, version, etc). Support for docker was missing the current build health, and was a pretty trivial addition.\n","permalink":"https://Agnes2.github.io/projects/contributions/shields-docker/","tags":["Docker","Rest APIs","JavaScript","node.js","JSON"],"title":"Added Docker Build Status Badge to shields.io"},{"categories":null,"contents":"While adding Structured Data to a client\u0026rsquo;s website I found some example JSON that was invalid.

If your passing around passwords or other sensitive info you should really implement SSL. SSL provides 2 main perks to your visitors.\nFirst it encrypts all communication that flies across the web. This prevents curious or devious billies from getting your secrets. Secondly it ensures to the user that your server is in fact who it claims, and not a nasty \u0026lsquo;man in the middle\u0026quot; attack. Finally it gives your site that touch of class\u0026hellip;. which of course a classy person like yourself relies on. Once you implement SSL certificates on your server you\u0026rsquo;ll want to require secure connections using Apache\u0026rsquo;s rewrite module. Now I won\u0026rsquo;t dwell on the creation and signing of certificates, its already well documented. If your just starting out though,heres a few links I recommend;\nCreating self-signed certificates (free, but should only be used internally or for testing, users will; see an \u0026lsquo;Untrusted\u0026quot; warning) Requesting a CA Signed certificate (not free, but the final certificate is trusted and seamless for users) The second link uses the schools internal CA, you will need to pay a public CA like Entrust or Verisign. All of this information is aimed at \u0026rsquo;nix or solaris servers running apache. Why? cause a production windows server is laughable :-p\nNow that you have a certificate, whats next? So there you are you have a shiny new Certificate and Server key, how do you force visitors to your apache driven site to use the SSL? You copied the certificates into the appropite locations right? And you have made the needed changes in httpd.conf right? So now when you view https://example.com you see a \u0026rsquo;trusted\u0026rsquo; warning or your site right? If No to any of these than this article does a pretty good job of outlining those steps.\nThe SSL Works, How do I force connections to use it? First you need to decide if you want to force every page on your site to use SSL, or only a particular sub-domain, or maybe just your admin directory. Since the overhead is minimal there is no harm is forcing the entire domain to leverage SSL, but if it is a self-signed certificate for your personal use than you\u0026rsquo;ll most certainly want to restrict its use to your own areas. This prevents users from seeing that nasty warning \u0026ldquo;This server is not trusted\u0026rdquo; You\u0026rsquo;ll know if your using SSL because the url prefix changes from http to https (s for secure).\nForcing entire domain to use SSL You want any visit, any where to use ssl. This probably the simplest solution. Create or append to your htaccess file in the top directory of your server. Some people use a port check (80 is typically http, while 443 is https) but if you have alernate configs or the user just adds :8080 to the end of the url this method is useless. Instead check whether the https environmental variable is set, if not then redirect.\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}$1 \\[R,L\\] Forcing sub-domains to use SSL Maybe you only want mysecretarea.example.com to use SSL, that\u0026rsquo;s easy enough. Its the same premise as above, but you move the htaccess file into the directory that corresponds to the subdomain. Also change the second line like below;\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://mysecretarea.%{SERVER_NAME}$1 \\[R,L\\] Forcing a directory to use SSL This method cn get a little hairier if your using aliases or redirects on top of this one. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to consider what order the commands are read. The basic principle is like so. You want all visits to example.com/admin to use ssl. Create a htaccess file in the parent directory. Again will check for the https variable, but this time we also check for the sub-directory to be in the path.\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on RewriteRule ^/admin/(.*)$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}/admin/$1 \\[R,L\\] ","permalink":"https://Agnes2.github.io/blog/force-ssl/","tags":["apache","apache","redirect","rewrite","ssl","web development"],"title":"Forcing Visits to use SSL"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Multiple plugins used by thousands of teams that provide enhanced functionality of Atlassian’s core products (primarily JIRA and Bamboo) to enrich CI/CD capabilities, DevOps automation, or productivity.
